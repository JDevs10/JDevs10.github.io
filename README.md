Creation of an original, unusual portfolio to present a few projects. Built with [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5), [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS), [JS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) and [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON).


## Live
Portfolio is live here :  https://jdevs10.github.io


## Permissions

I'm cool with anyone using the code or parts of the code for their own site, it is open source so people can learn from it and adapt it. 
However, I would encourage you to modify the theme it to make it your own. If you are using the site's design largely unmodified, I'd appreciate being credited as the designer of the website.

I do not give permission to present any of my projects as your own (this is being actively used as my portfolio site and these are my real projects I've worked on).
